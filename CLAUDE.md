# CLAUDE.md — BidDeed.AI / Everest Capital USA

## Who I Am
Ariel Shapira. Solo founder of BidDeed.AI and Everest Capital USA. 10+ years foreclosure investing in Brevard County, Florida. Licensed FL broker and general contractor. Building an AI-powered foreclosure auction intelligence platform. ADHD — I need systems that run themselves.

## My Stack
- **Repos:** github.com/breverdbidder/* (cli-anything-biddeed, zonewise-scraper-v4, biddeed-ai, biddeed-ai-ui, zonewise-web, cliproxy-gateway, tax-insurance-optimizer)
- **Database:** Supabase (mocerqjnksmhcjzxrewo.supabase.co) — multi_county_auctions (245K rows), activities, insights, daily_metrics
- **Compute:** Hetzner everest-dispatch (87.99.129.125) with CLIProxyAPI on 127.0.0.1:8317
- **AI:** Gemini Flash (FREE via CLIProxyAPI), DeepSeek V3.2 ($0.28/1M), Claude (Max plan, never API)
- **Deploy:** GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Pages + Render
- **Brand:** Navy #1E3A5F, Orange #F59E0B, Inter font, bg #020617

## Context Rules

When I mention an auction or property → query Supabase `multi_county_auctions` first
When I mention a case number → search `multi_county_auctions` by case_number field
When analyzing a deal → apply max bid formula: (ARV×70%)-Repairs-$10K-MIN($25K,15%×ARV)
When I ask about pipeline health → check `daily_metrics` and recent GitHub Action runs
When I mention a county → check if config exists in `counties/` before assuming anything
When something needs building → follow cli-anything HARNESS.md 7-phase pattern
When deploying code → push to GitHub, never local installs or Google Drive
When spending money → stop and confirm if >$10/session
When I context-switch mid-task → flag it: "📌 [previous task] is still open"
When I say "Summit" → execute immediately, no questions, no clarification

## How I Work
- Direct, no softening language. Facts and actions.
- Cost discipline: $10/session max. Batch operations. One attempt per approach.
- Zero HITL: try 3 alternatives before surfacing a blocker.
- Execute first, report results. Don't ask what to do.
- Push back with strong opinions when you disagree.
- Wrong = "I was wrong." Never invent numbers.

## Slash Commands
- `/auction-brief` — morning auction briefing from Supabase
- `/county-setup` — onboard a new Florida county
- `/deal-intel` — process foreclosure documents into structured data
- `/tldr` — end-of-session summary, updates memory.md
- `/transcript` — YouTube video analysis via Hetzner pipeline

## Family Context (when relevant)
- Wife Mariam: runs Property360 real estate, Protection Partners insurance, contracting
- Son Michael (16): D1 competitive swimmer, Satellite Beach HS, keto diet, Shabbat observance
- Orthodox practices: Shabbat (no work Fri sunset–Sat havdalah), kosher, holidays


## Design System
- Read DESIGN.md before any UI work
- Navy #1E3A5F (surfaces), Amber #F59E0B (accent/CTA), Void #020617 (background)
- Inter (UI text) + JetBrains Mono (financial data)
- No pill buttons, no light mode, no gradients on buttons

## Behavioral Discipline (Karpathy Guidelines)

> Adapted from [forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills) · MIT License · ~14k★ · Karpathy-starred.
> Adopted by Everest Capital 2026-04-12. This section is **complementary** to the existing HONESTY PROTOCOL, PAIRING RULE, COST DISCIPLINE, and CLI-ANYTHING mandates above — it does not replace them.

**Tradeoff posture:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks (typo fix, one-line config), use judgment and skip the ceremony.

### K1. Think Before Coding *(reinforces HONESTY PROTOCOL)*

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, label as `INFERRED` per HONESTY PROTOCOL.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

**Everest delta:** when an assumption is surfaced, it must carry a `VERIFIED / UNTESTED / INFERRED` tag. Wrong `VERIFIED` = 3× penalty to honesty_violations table.

### K2. Simplicity First *(complements XGBoost efficiency cap)*

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and 50 would do, rewrite.

Ask: "Would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

**Everest delta:** this is per-diff. XGBoost efficiency (90 min/chat, max 3 chats/task) is per-session. Both apply.

### K3. Surgical Changes *(NEW — closes AUTOLOOP evolver bloat gap)*

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, **mention it — don't delete it.**

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless explicitly asked.

**The test:** every changed line must trace directly to the user's request.

**Everest delta — AUTOLOOP V2 evolver constraint:** prompt/rule updates produced by the evolver must be **minimal and surgical**. Diffs that exceed 20% line growth or touch sections unrelated to the failing case must be rejected by the evolver's self-check and re-attempted with a narrower edit. This closes the bloat failure mode flagged by Dylan Cleppe's extraction-funnel analysis (2026-04-12) and by Karpathy directly.

### K4. Goal-Driven Execution *(complements EG14 gate)*

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**Everest delta:** for SUMMIT dispatches touching production (zonewise-web, dify-zonewise, nexus), the EG14 14-point enterprise gate is the canonical success criteria. Goal-driven execution at the sub-task level must compose up to an EG14 verdict, not replace it.

### Working indicators

These guidelines are working if:
- Fewer unnecessary changes appear in diffs.
- Fewer rewrites happen due to overcomplication.
- Clarifying questions arrive *before* implementation, not after mistakes.
- AUTOLOOP evolver prompt diffs stay small and targeted.
