# ZoneWise.AI vs Zoneomics + Forma: Competitive Gap Analysis

**Date**: January 31, 2026  
**Strategic Context**: Zoneomics partnered with Autodesk Forma (Aug 2024) to provide "3D Envelope by Zoneomics" extension  
**Mission**: ZoneWise must match or exceed everything Zoneomics + Forma provide together

---

## 🎯 THE COMPETITIVE REALITY

Zoneomics is NOT just a data provider. They are **integrated into Autodesk's AEC ecosystem** via Forma extension, creating a complete workflow from zoning lookup → 3D envelope → environmental analysis.

**Your customer's alternative**: Pay Zoneomics $61-186/mo + Autodesk AEC Collection (~$2,510/yr) and get everything.

**ZoneWise must beat this** with a better, cheaper, or more complete solution.

## 🎯 COMPETITIVE STRATEGY OPTIONS

### Option A: "Better Data, Lower Price" (CURRENT PATH)
Focus on superior zoning data quality (verified sources) at lower price.

**Pros**: Achievable now, clear differentiation  
**Cons**: Doesn't compete on visualization/analysis

**Features**:
- ✅ 100% verified DIMS with source URLs
- ✅ 3D envelope generation
- ❌ No environmental analysis
- Target: $49-99/mo

---

### Option B: "Full Stack Alternative" (AMBITIOUS)
Build everything Zoneomics+Forma provides.

**Pros**: Direct competitor, larger TAM  
**Cons**: 6-12 months dev, needs environmental analysis expertise

**Features**:
- ✅ Verified zoning data
- ✅ 3D envelope generation
- ✅ Sun/shadow analysis
- ✅ Wind analysis (ML-based rapid)
- ✅ Microclimate
- Target: $149-249/mo (still 50% cheaper)

---

### Option C: "Partnership Strategy" (HYBRID)
Partner with environmental analysis providers, own the zoning layer.

**Pros**: Faster to market, leverage existing tech  
**Cons**: Margin sharing, dependency

**Potential Partners**:
- **Ladybug Tools** (open source sun/wind analysis)
- **SimScale** (CFD simulation API)
- **cove.tool** (energy analysis)
- **Sefaira** (Trimble - daylight analysis)

## 🔬 TECHNICAL GAP ANALYSIS: ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

### Sun/Shadow Analysis (Achievable in 2-4 weeks)

**What It Does**: Calculate sun hours at any point for any date/time

**How To Build**:
```javascript
// Libraries needed
import SunCalc from 'suncalc';  // Sun position calculations
import * as THREE from 'three'; // Ray casting for shadows

// Algorithm:
// 1. Get sun position (azimuth, altitude) for date/time/location
// 2. Create directional light at sun position
// 3. Cast rays from grid points on ground/facade
// 4. Count hours where ray is not blocked
```

**NPM Packages**:
- `suncalc` (2K stars) - Sun/moon position calculations
- `three.js` - Ray casting for shadow detection

**Complexity**: 🟡 MEDIUM (2-4 weeks Claude Code)

---

### Wind Analysis (Hard - Need ML or CFD)

**What Forma Does**: 
- Rapid (AI): ML model trained on CFD simulations
- Detailed: Full CFD simulation

**How To Build**:
1. **Partner with SimScale** (CFD API) - $50-500/simulation
2. **Use OpenFOAM** (open source CFD) - requires expertise
3. **Train ML model** on public CFD datasets - 3-6 months

**Complexity**: 🔴 VERY HARD (requires specialized expertise)

**Recommendation**: Partner or defer to Phase 3

---

### Microclimate (Combines Sun + Wind + Weather)

**Dependencies**: Requires sun AND wind analysis first

**Additional Data Needed**:
- Local weather data (OpenWeatherMap API)
- Material properties (albedo, thermal mass)

**Complexity**: 🔴 VERY HARD (after sun + wind are solved)

---

## 📋 RECOMMENDED ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Data + 3D Envelope (NOW - 4 weeks)
**Goal**: Match Zoneomics data quality + basic 3D envelope

| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Complete Malabar 100% stable |
| 2 | 3D envelope generator (Three.js) |
| 3 | Map integration (Mapbox + Three.js) |
| 4 | Basic UI + export (PNG, basic mesh) |

**Competitive Position**: ✅ Better data quality, comparable 3D

---

### Phase 2: Sun/Shadow Analysis (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal**: Add first environmental analysis feature

| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| 5 | SunCalc integration |
| 6 | Shadow ray casting |
| 7 | Sun hours heatmap visualization |
| 8 | Date/time animation |

**Competitive Position**: ✅ Now comparable to basic Forma features

---

### Phase 3: Partnership for Advanced Analysis (Weeks 9-16)
**Goal**: Wind + microclimate via partnership or API

| Option | Partner | Cost | Time |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| A | SimScale API | $50-500/sim | 2 weeks integration |
| B | Ladybug Tools | Free (open source) | 4-6 weeks |
| C | Build ML model | Dev time | 3-6 months |

---

### Phase 4: Scale Coverage (Ongoing)
**Goal**: Expand beyond Brevard

| Approach | Coverage | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| Custom scraping | 67 FL counties | Dev time |
| Zoneomics API | 9,000+ cities | $61-186/mo |
| Hybrid | FL custom, others via API | Mixed |

---

## ✅ BOTTOM LINE

### What ZoneWise MUST Have to Compete:

| Feature | Priority | Timeline |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **100% Verified Zoning Data** | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ DONE (Malabar) |
| **3D Envelope Generator** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Week 1-2 |
| **Map + 3D Integration** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Week 2-3 |
| **Sun/Shadow Analysis** | 🟠 HIGH | Week 5-8 |
| **Export (PNG, IFC, OBJ)** | 🟠 HIGH | Week 4-6 |
| **Wind Analysis** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Phase 3 (partnership) |
| **Microclimate** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Phase 3 |
| **Multi-County Coverage** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Ongoing |

### What Sets ZoneWise APART:

1. **Source Verification** - Municode URLs vs "AI-processed"
2. **Price** - 60-70% cheaper target
3. **Local Depth** - Deep Brevard expertise vs broad/shallow
4. **Conversational AI** - Natural language queries (your unique feature)
5. **Development Intelligence** - Full lifecycle, not just early design

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

**Don't try to out-Forma Forma on environmental analysis (yet).**

Instead, win on:
1. **Better zoning data** (verified sources)
2. **Lower price** ($49-149 vs $395/mo)
3. **Local expertise** (Brevard deep knowledge)
4. **AI-native UX** (conversational, not legacy CAD)
5. **Development lifecycle** (discovery → analysis → permitting)

Add environmental analysis via partnership (SimScale, Ladybug) rather than building CFD/ML expertise from scratch.
